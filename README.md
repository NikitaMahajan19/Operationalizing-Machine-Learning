# Operationalizing Machine Learning

In this project, I have used the Bank Marketing dataset. The aim is to operationalize machine learning by creating a model, deploying it and consuming it, so that we can get an endpoint that can easily be used by the end-user. Also I will be creating, publishing, and consuming a pipeline by creating a pipeline endpoint.

Following step will be followed in this project:
Creating Automated ML model
Deploy the model
Consuming the deployed model ( Swagger documentation)
Create Pipeline
Consume created Pipeline and Deploy it

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screencasts required to demonstrate key steps. 

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
