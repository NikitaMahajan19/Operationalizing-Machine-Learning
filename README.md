# Operationalizing Machine Learning

In this project, I have used the Bank Marketing dataset. The aim is to operationalize machine learning by creating a model, deploying it and consuming it, so that we can get an endpoint that can easily be used by the end-user. Also I will be creating, publishing, and consuming a pipeline by creating a pipeline endpoint.

Following step will be followed in this project:
Creating Automated ML model
Deploy the model
Consuming the deployed model ( Swagger documentation)
Create Pipeline
Consume created Pipeline and Deploy it
